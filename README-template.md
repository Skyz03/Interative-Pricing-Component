## Overview
This was a relatively a fun challenge where I learned how to make custom sliders plus all the benefits of ```background-position``` and CSS Grid styles.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

## My process
Made the components and build the grid and edited the slider with some JS application.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I learned to make custom sliders input range sliders, then a bit more detail about the CSS Grid system.


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
